Instructions in [guides](./docs/guides/)

## Notice
Nyan Doom code is based off [DSDA-Doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom). This means that certain features already in DSDA-Doom (and by extension Nyan Doom) may be broken or unfinished, especially in regards to Heretic and Hexen support. Here is some documentation on those features:

<details markdown="1">

  <summary>Heretic Support</summary>

### Heretic Support
- Nyan Doom includes demo-compatible support for heretic (all the demos stored on dsda are in sync).
- Heretic game logic should be set automatically if you use `HERETIC.WAD` as the iwad. If it doesn't work, please use the `-heretic` commandline option. This flips a switch in the engine that determines all the core game data.
- Don't need to supply complevel (heretic is complevel 0 by necessity)
- Known issues
  - Setting the "Status Bar and Menu Appearance" option to "not adjusted" will have no effect for heretic (it will default instead to "Doom format").
  - The "Apply multisampling" automap option is disabled for heretic.
  - Automap colors are not configurable for heretic.
  - Some of the more advanced features are not implemented for heretic yet, and using them may cause crashes or other odd behaviour.
  - Dehacked support for heretic isn't implemented yet.
  - Some menus extend over the hud.

</details>

  <summary>Hexen Support</summary>

### Hexen Support
- Nyan Doom includes demo-compatible support for hexen.
  - Use -iwad HEXEN.WAD (-file HEXDD.WAD for the expansion)
    - Or drag wads onto the exe
  - You can force hexen engine behaviour with `-hexen` (shouldn't be necessary)
- Don't need to supply complevel (hexen is complevel 0 by necessity)
- Known issues
  - Setting the "Status Bar and Menu Appearance" option to "not adjusted" will have no effect for hexen (it will default instead to "Doom format")
  - The "Apply multisampling" automap option is disabled for hexen
  - Automap colors are not configurable for hexen
  - Some of the more advanced features are not implemented for hexen yet, and using them may cause crashes or other odd behaviour.
  - Some menus extend over the hud.
  - Monster counter doesn't work as expected, due to cluster format (ex hud / levelstat)
  - Hexen-style skies aren't implemented yet (layering, etc)
  - The ALTSHADOW thing flag isn't affecting the rendering
  - Dynamic fade palettes aren't being used
  - The yellow message variant isn't implemented
