## GAMEVERS Lump

The GAMEVERS lump can be used only when the [COMPLVL](complvl.md) lump has the key of `vanilla`, to specify an exact vanilla complevel and [limit-removing](limit_removing.md).

GAMEVERS will not be read if COMPLVL is absent or if COMPLVL has any other key than `vanilla`.

The order of precedence is highest to lowest: parameter > lump > config. This means that if a another complevel is set and/or if limit-removing isn't in the parameters (example: `-complevel 2`), the GAMEVERS `limit` will be ignored and the game will run **without** limit-removing.

### Specification

The GAMEVERS lump has a key and a value:

`key value`

The `key` defines the specific complevel, while the `value` defines limit-removing or not. The `value` can be ommited to run in normal mode.

### Keys

- `1.2`
  - Selects complevel 0, for Doom 1.2 compatibility.
- `1.666`
  - Selects complevel 1, for Doom 1.666 compatibility.
- `1.9`
  - Selects complevel 2, for Doom (pre-ultimate) / Doom 2 compatibility.
- `ultimate`
  - Selects complevel 3, for Ultimate Doom compatibility.
- `final`
  - Selects complevel 4, for Final Doom (Plutonia, TNT) compatibility.
- `limit`
  - Allows the port to automatically detect the vanilla complevel, while activating limit-removing.
  - When using this, the second `value` is not needed.

### Values

- `limit`
  - Runs complevel under [limit-removing](limit_removing.md) mode. Removes overflow errors and emulation. Omit to run in normal mode. (Note this can be overriden by parameters).
