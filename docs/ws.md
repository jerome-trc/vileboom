# Widescreen Native Lump Support

VileBoom supports new widescreen background and statusbar lumps with the prefix `W_`.

When any of the `widescreen` lumps are loaded within a WAD, they will take priority over the following `original` lumps.

Note there are no widescreen versions for [animated lumps](animbg.md) as animate lumps take priority over widescreen lumps. The lump priority is: `start/end animations` > `widescreen` > `original`.
